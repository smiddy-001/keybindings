# keybindings
A big list of keybinds for apps and operating systems and how their keybinds connect and integrate seamlessley 
I am just starting in linux and noticing a shitload more keybinds I need to remember and most of em can and should be different.
I believe a global keybind list for all tasks and actions to be the same.

I also took a liking to vim and its excelently orchestrated keybinds and how people who are familiar with them can speed through their workflow which is something I believe was learned through time and repetition and don't understand why we haven't got a big list of keybinds that over long term increase productivity and efficiency.

| Key | Action |
|-------:|:------|
| $mod q | close file |
| $mod n | new file |
| $mod shift n | new file as ... |
| $mod n | new file |
