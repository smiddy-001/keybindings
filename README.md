# keybindings
A big list of keybinds for apps and operating systems and how their keybinds connect and integrate seamlessley 
I am just starting in linux and noticing a shitload more keybinds I need to remember and most of em can and should be different.
I believe a global keybind list for all tasks and actions to be the same.

I took a liking to vim and its excelently orchestrated keybinds and how people who are familiar with them speed through workflows and documents.
And speed is something that was learned through mostly time and repetition and if we globalised keybinds we can increase productivity and efficiency.

| Key | Action |
|-------:|:------|
| $mod q | close file |
| $mod n | new file |
| $mod shift n | new file as ... |
| $mod n | new file |
